\title{Create a list of gene sets based on Gene Ontology terms}
\usage{
GOGeneSets(species = "Hs", ontologies = c("MF"))
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{A single character value specifying a choice of species,
such as "Dm" ("Drosophila_melanogaster"), "Hs" ("Homo_sapiens"),
"Rn" ("Rattus_norvegicus") or "Mm" ("Mus_musculus").}

\item{ontologies}{A single character value or a character vector
specifying an ontology or multiple ontologies. Valid format could be any
combination of "BP", "MF" and "CC".}
}
\value{
A list of gene sets, with names as GO IDs. Each gene set is
a character vector of Entrez identifiers.
}
\description{
This function creates a list of gene sets based on Gene Ontology terms.
It is species-specific, and returns a list of gene sets, each
of which is a character vector of Entrez identifiers.
}
\details{
This function relies on the following packages:
AnnotationDbi, GO.db and the species db, such as org.Dm.eg.db.
}
\examples{
library(GO.db)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
HS_GO_CC <- GOGeneSets(species="Hs",ontologies=c("CC"))

HS_GO <- GOGeneSets(species="Hs",ontologies=c("CC", "MF", "BP"))
