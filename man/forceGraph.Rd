\description{
This function creates a force-directed graph using \pkg{htmlwidgets}, which can be rendered
in R Markdown documents and shiny applications.
The rendering is conducted using a variant of the Sigma which is a JavaScript library dedicated
to graph drawing. The force-graph layout algorithm is ForceAtlas2
