Description: This package provides classes and methods for gene set over-representation, 
             enrichment and network analyses on various high-throughput data as well as 
             corresponding time-series data generated by CRISPR, RNAi, RNA-seq and micro-array. 
             The over-representation analysis is based on hypergeometric test and the 
             enrichment analysis is based on the GSEA algorithm published by 
             (Subramanian et al.PNAS 2005). The network analysis could identify the enriched
             subnetworks based on the algorithms from BioNet package(Beisser et al., Bioinformatics 2010). 
             A pipeline function is provided for CRISPR data preprocessed by MAGeCK, 
             which is seamless linked with MAGeCK. Time series data analysis could also be 
             performed for better mutual comparison. Finally, a dynamic shiny report could be 
             generated encompassing all the results, allowing users to modify the visualization 
             part and download results in different formats.
