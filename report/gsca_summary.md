### Summary

The enrichment analysis was performed using the phenotype vector including 13546 genes and 11075 genes used after filtering.


This analysis was performed using the gene set collection(s):
- GO_MF ( 2141 gene sets, of which 26 were above the minimum size )
- H_MSig ( 50 gene sets, of which 0 were above the minimum size )
- PW_KEGG ( 134 gene sets, of which 10 were above the minimum size )

The following methods were used:
- Hypergeometric test
 + Significant gene set cutoff p-value (adjusted): 0.05
 + MHT correction method: BH
 + Minimum gene set size: 100

- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
 + Significant gene set cutoff p-value (adjusted): 0.05
 + Minimum gene set size: 100
 + MHT correction method: BH
 + Number of permutations: 100
 + Exponent: 1
