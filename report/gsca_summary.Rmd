### Summary

The enrichment analysis was performed using the phenotype vector including `r gsca@summary$gl[, "input"]` genes and `r gsca@summary$gl[, "converted to entrez"]` genes used after filtering.


This analysis was performed using the gene set collection(s):
`r generateGSCSummary(gsca)`

The following methods were used:
`r generateMethodsSummary(gsca)`
